# Z80VirtualMachineKit

This a personal project oriented to learn to code in Swift.

The target is to create a complete ZX Spectrum emulator library.

To compile this project you must install XCode 8 Beta and enable Swift 3 support.

Some Bus and BusComponent structures have been inspired by the work in https://efepuntomarcos.wordpress.com/2012/08/27/hazte-un-spectrum-1-parte/#comments (develop of YASS emulator).
